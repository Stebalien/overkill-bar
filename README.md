Overkill-bar
============

Overkill-bar is a collection of widgets that can be used with
[Overkill](https://github.com/Stebalien/overkill) and
[bar-aint-recursive](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) to draw a text-based
status bar.

Currently, the widgets assume that you have the
[siji](https://github.com/stark/siji) bitmap font installed and set as your
backup bar-aint-recursive font.

Future Work
-----------

These widgets could probably be less bar-aint-recursive specific. One potential
improvement would be to make them generic and then convert them to the
bar-aint-recursive format in the Bar class itself.
